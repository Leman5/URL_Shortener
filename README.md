# URL_Shortener

This is a basic URL shortener. It does what a normal one does: takes a long URL, makes a short one, and redirects. This project is special to me because I built it end-to-end in 4 hours (planning to deployment) right after an interview rejection for not knowing FastAPI. I learned FastAPI properly and used it here.
